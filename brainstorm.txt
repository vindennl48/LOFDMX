LOF Python App

Needs to control the following:
  - Connection to my pedalboard; ie. port the existing fighter twister program
  - Options for Reaper
    - to restart, open songs, change interfaces, etc.
    - to open in song mode or live mode
    - Options to clear the recording folder
    - Options to upload existing song data
  - DMX Control
    - This will set up a midi device to accept direction from Reaper to convert
      to DMX code.
    - Create a screen to send preset commands or scenes to the DMX lights
    - Create a screen to manipulate the midi notes vs the colors? or at the very
      least to list out what midi controls what DMX

Need to figure out how to get reaper to send CC messages as automation (i
believe i figured this out at one point already)
